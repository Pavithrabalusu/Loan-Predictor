# 💰 Loan Predictor

A full-stack Machine Learning web application that predicts the likelihood of a loan being approved based on applicant details. Built using **Django**, **Streamlit**, and **XGBoost**, this project showcases end-to-end development: from backend APIs and ML model training to a simple, interactive frontend.
